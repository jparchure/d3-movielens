# movielens

A visualization for the movie lens dataset- http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/
The data file used is called "movies_edited.csv"
There is a spinoff off this file called movietable.csv used in the stacked bar chart example

Even though the example works, there is a ton of work left.
It is intended to be a small project to practise d3. My personal contribution is implementing the code in a structured manner instead of a massive block of code as shown in examples around the web.

Planned features
1. More visualizations
2. More interactivity
3. Better CSS
4. Use of OOPS concept
5. Better data manipulation
